## Purpose

It is currently difficult for new players to figure out competitive Pok√©mon and this can dissuade them from playing. We want to lower the barrier to entry in order to encourage more players to join. Additionally, this can be a good resource for more experienced players to quickly access relevant information that they may need when constructing new teams.

## Algorithms

This project compares Radix and Merge sort. Both algorithms are used to sort the pokemon in descending order, and the times they take are compared.


## Build

Make sure you have node/npm installed on your system

- cd node
- npm install .
- npm run start
